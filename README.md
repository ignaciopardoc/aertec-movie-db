## Explanation

The App itself is very simple.

As usual, just clone the repository and run npm i (remember that you must have installed the latest version of Node.js on your system)

On the App you can just search a movie on the input text and automatically it will connect to The Movie Database API to get the results. Then it shows you the first 20 results sorted by popularity. If you click on any movie, it will lead you to the detail page where you can see more information about the movie and a video about it.

If you are not an English speaker you can just select on the dropdown the language you prefer (at this moment is available English, Spanish and German).

Enjoy it!
